# TODO
# Display a tkinter welcome screen (press any button to continue)
# Display the settings page. This also grabs pre-existing settings from a file
# Display the actual game in a good grid based on number of moles.
#   The moles are tkinter labels that change images based on their state

# Lots of functions, will need to reorder a lot of things

import tkinter, time, os


# Function to check if settings file exists. File will be json, if there's no file,
#   set the settings dictionary to default values

# Function to create and display welcome screen. destroy tk when done

# Function to create and display settings screen. bring in the settings dict,
#   change the values with a tk spinbox (or entry. we'll see.)
