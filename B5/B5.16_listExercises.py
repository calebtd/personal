President Trump has been asking aides and lawyers, including White House counsel Pat Cipollone, about his 
self-pardon power, multiple sources tell CNN. 

Some of those conversations have happened in recent weeks, one of the sources said. It is unclear if it has 
come up since the mayhem at the Capitol building yesterday fomented by the Presidentâ€™s rhetoric or after his 
recent controversial call with the Georgia secretary of state. Trump has asked about the legal and political 
consequences of a self-pardon, according to a source close to the President. He has also asked for legal 
opinions on whether he has the authority to issue a self-pardon and has been advised on the potential political 
fallout. This person said it was not yet clear whether the President would follow through with a pardon for himself.
